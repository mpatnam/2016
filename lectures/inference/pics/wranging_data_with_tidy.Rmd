title: Data Wrangling with `tidyr` and `dplyr` 
author: Stephanie Hicks, Rafael Irizarry

The data analysis process can be thought about in four parts

1. Data cleaning
2. Data transformation 
3. Data visualization
4. Modeling

where we each of these steps need their own tools and software to complete. 

![Bottlenecks in data analysis](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science.png)

As we have seen in class, one of the most time-consuming aspects of 
the data analysis process is "data wrangling". This is also known 
as "data munging", which is a trendy term for 
_cleaning up a messy data set_. This refers to the first two steps in the 
data analysis process: 

1. Data cleaning (or tidying data)
2. Data transformation 


It can take a long time to clean and transform messy data into a format 
that is useful for data visualization and modeling, but there are tools 
that can help turn messy data into clean data. 

We have learned some functions in the R package `dplyr` that can 
transform and summarize tabular data with rows and columns. Today we will 
learn about: 

* advanced dplyr functionality to help with the "data transformation" step  
* how to get a clean data set or how to "tidy" a data set

### Defining data structures 

There are many ways to define the structure of a data set. 
Most data frames are made up of **rows** and **columns** where the columns 
are almost always labeled and the rows are *sometimes* labeled. 

For example, a data set could be structured in the following way: 

* each row represents one company (row names are companies)
* each column represent one time point
* the stock prices are defined for each row/column pair

```{r}
set.seed(123)
stocks <- rbind("Google" = rnorm(5, 100, 1), "Facebook" = rnorm(5, 100, 2), 
  "Twitter" = rnorm(5, 100, 4))
colnames(stocks) <- as.character(as.Date('2016-01-01') + 0:4)
stocks
```

Alternatively, a data set can be structured in the following way:

* each row represents one time point (but no row names)
* the first column defines the time variable and the last three columns contain the stock prices for three companies 

```{r}
set.seed(123)
stocks <- data.frame( time = as.Date('2016-01-01') + 0:4,
  "Google" = rnorm(5, 100, 1), "Facebook" = rnorm(5, 100, 2), 
  "Twitter" = rnorm(5, 100, 4))
stocks
```

In both cases, the data is the same, but the structure is different. This 
can be  _frustrating_ to deal with because the meaning of the 
values (rows and columns) in the two data sets are different. Providing a 
standardized way of organizing values within a data set would alleviate 
a major portion of this frustration.  


### Defining tidy data

Now, we will introduce the concept of **tidy** data. Tidy data is a 
standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure.
The properties of a tidy data set are based on: 

* Each column is a variable
* Each rows is an observation

Working with tidy data is useful because it creates a structured way of
organizing data values within a data set. This makes the data analysis 
process more efficient and simplifies the development of data analysis tools
that work together. In this way, you can focus on the problem you are
investigating, rather than the uninteresting logistics of data.  


### What is `tidyr`?

[`tidyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)
is an R package that transforms data sets to a tidy format. 

There are two main functions in `tidyr`: 

* `gather()` = takes multiple columns, and gathers them into key-value pairs  
(it makes "wide" data longer)
* `separate()` = turns a single character column into multiple columns
(it makes "long" data wider)

We'll explore what it means to go between a "wide" and "long" 
data format using `gather()` and `separate()` next. 


### How do I get tidyr? 

To install `tidyr`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyr")
```

To load `tidyr`

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
```

For motivation, a tidy version of the stock data we looked at above
looks like this: (we'll learn how the functions work in just a moment)

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
stocks %>% 
    gather(company, price, Google:Twitter)
```

In this "tidy" data set, we have three columns representing three variables 
(time, company name and stock price). Every row represents contains one
stock price from a particular time and for a specific company. 

### Pipe operator: %>%

We have introduced the operator: `%>%`. 
dplyr imports this operator from another package (`magrittr` [see help file here](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html)). 
This operator allows you to pipe the output from one function to 
the input of another function. Instead of nesting functions (reading 
from the inside to the outside), the idea of of piping is to read the 
functions from left to right. 

Now in this case, we pipe the `stocks` data frame to the function that will 
gather multiple columns into key-value pairs. 


# Data 

## 2016 Iowa Presidential Caucus 

We will explore [public poll data from HuffPost Pollster](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster) 
from the 2016 Iowa [Democratic](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-caucus) and [Republican](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-republican-caucus) 
Presidential Caucus.

First we will read in the data:
```{r}
library(readr)
dem_polls = read_csv("http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-caucus.csv")
rep_polls = read_csv("http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-republican-caucus.csv")
```

Let's take a look at data
```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(dem_polls)
View(rep_polls)

glimpse(dem_polls)
glimpse(rep_polls)
```

We see there is a lot of information in each data frame.  First let's use 
`dplyr` to select a subset of the columns.  
```{r}
dem_polls <- dem_polls %>% 
                select(Pollster, `End Date`, Clinton:Undecided)

rep_polls <- rep_polls %>% 
                select(Pollster, `End Date`, Trump:Walker)
```

In the democratic and republican polling data sets, there is one column 
representing the polling percentages for each candidate, 
similar to the stock price data set with multiple columns 
representing different companies.  To **tidy** it, we need to *gather* these 
columns into a two-column *key-value* pair.  This is often described as 
transforming a _wide_ data set into a _long_ data set.  




# gather()

This function gathers multiple columns and collapses them into new 
*key-value* pairs. This transform data from _wide_ format into 
a _long_ format. 

* The `key` is the name of the _new_ column that you are creating which 
contains the values of the column headings that you are gathering 
* The `value` is the name of the _new_ column that will contain the values
themselves
* The third argument defines the columns to gather

```{r}
dem_polls %>% 
    gather(key = candidate, value = percentage, Clinton:Undecided)
```

To select a range of columns by name, use the ":" (colon) operator

#### Assessment 
Using the democratic poll data, apply the `gather()` function 
to tidy the poll data by _excluding_ the Pollster and End Date columns, 
rather than directly providing the column names to gather.  

Hint: Look at the `gather()` help file on how to exclude column names.

```{r}
## Provide your code here

dem_polls %>% 
    gather(key = candidate, value = percentage, -c(Pollster, `End Date`))

## To select all the columns *except* a specific column, 
## use the "-" (subtraction) operator (also known as negative indexing)
```


#### Assessment
Using the "tidy" democratic poll data, use dplyr to filter for only 
the following candidates (Clinton, Sanders, O'Malley) and for polls 
only ending after May 1, 2015. 

```{r}
## Provide your code here

dem_polls %>% 
    gather(key = candidate, value = percentage, Clinton:Undecided) %>%
    filter(candidate %in% c("Clinton", "Sanders", "O'Malley") & 
           `End Date` >= "2015-05-01")
```

#### Assessment (optional)
Using the tidy and filtered democratic poll data set, 
use `ggplot2` to plot the results from each poll (percentage) for each
of the candiates. Color the color the points by the candidate. 

Try reading the help file for `geom_smooth()` to overlay a smoothed 
line across the points. Don't worry if you don't know what it means.
We'll get to it later in the course. 

```{r}
## Provide your code here

library(ggplot2)

dem_polls %>% 
    gather(key = candidate, value = percentage, Clinton:Undecided) %>%
    filter(candidate %in% c("Clinton", "Sanders", "O'Malley") & 
           `End Date` >= "2015-05-01") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=`End Date`, y = percentage, color = candidate)) + 
    geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```


#### Assessment (optional) 
Repeat this analysis using the republican poll data. 
Filter for candidates (Trump, Cruz, Rubio, Carson, Bush, Paul, Fiorina) 
and for polls only after May 1, 2015. Color the points by candidates. 

```{r}
## Provide your code here

rep_polls %>% 
    gather(key = candidate, value = percentage, Trump:Walker) %>%
    filter(candidate %in% c("Trump", "Cruz", "Rubio", "Carson", 
                            "Bush", "Paul", "Fiorina") & 
           `End Date` >= "2015-05-01") %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=`End Date`, y = percentage, color = candidate)) + 
    geom_point() + stat_smooth()
```




# spread()

In contrast to *gathering* multiple columns into key-value pairs, we can 
*spread* a key-value pair across multiple columns.  

The function `spread()` does just that. It transforms data from a _long_
format into a _wide_ format. 

* The `key` is the name of the column in your data set that 
contains the values of the column headings that you are spreading across 
multiple columns
* The `value` is the name of the column that contains the values for the 
multiple columns


```{r}
dem_polls_gathered <- dem_polls %>% 
                         gather(key = candidate, value = percentage, 
                                Clinton:Undecided)
dem_polls_gathered

dem_polls_gathered %>% 
    spread(key = candidate, value = percentage)
```


## Other supporting functions in tidyr

* `separate()` = separate one column into multiple columns
* `unite()` = unite multiple columns into one

```{r}
dem_polls_separate <- dem_polls %>% 
                        separate(col = `End Date`, into = c("y", "m", "d"))
dem_polls_separate
```

#### Assessment

Use the `unite()` function to create a new column titled "end_date" that 
combines the columns `y`, `m` and `d` together into a single column separated 
by the "/" character. 

```{r}
## Provide your code here

dem_polls_separate %>% 
    unite(col = end_date, y, m, d, sep = "/")
```


# Advanced dplyr

We have now learned how to obtain a clean (or _tidy_) data set. The next step 
in the the data analysis process is to transform and summarize data. When 
data is a tabular format, you have seen how we can use `dplyr` to `filter()` 
rows, `select()` columns and add new columns using `mutate()`. Now we will 
explore some more advanced dplyr functionality.  

### Brief recap of dplyr

[`dplyr`](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) 
is a powerful R-package to transform and summarize tabular data with rows 
and columns. 

The package contains a set of functions (or "verbs") to perform common data 
manipulation operations such as filtering for rows, selecting specific 
columns, re-ordering rows, adding new columns and summarizing data. 
In addition, `dplyr` contains a useful function to perform another common task 
which is the is the "split-apply-combine" concept.  We will discuss that in a
little bit. 

# Data

## mammals sleep

The `msleep` (mammals sleep) data set contains the sleeptimes and weights for 
a set of mammals and is available in the [`data` repository on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencelabs/data/master/msleep_ggplot2.csv). 
This data set contains 83 rows and 11 variables.  

To load the `msleep` data set

```{r}
msleep <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencelabs/data/master/msleep_ggplot2.csv")
msleep
```

The columns (in order) correspond to the following: 

column name | Description
--- | ---
`name` | common name
`genus` | taxonomic rank
`vore` | carnivore, omnivore or herbivore?
`order` | taxonomic rank
`conservation` | the conservation status of the mammal
`sleep_total` | total amount of sleep, in hours
`sleep_rem` | rem sleep, in hours
`sleep_cycle` | length of sleep cycle, in hours
`awake` | amount of time spent awake, in hours
`brainwt` | brain weight in kilograms
`bodywt` | body weight in kilograms


# Important `dplyr` verbs to remember

`dplyr` verbs | Description
--- | ---
`select()` | select columns 
`mutate()` | create new columns
`filter()` | filter rows
`arrange()` | re-order or arrange rows
`summarise()` | summarise values
`group_by()` | allows for group operations in the "split-apply-combine" concept



# `dplyr` verbs in action

### `select()` and `mutate`() columns; `filter()` rows

The two most basic functions are `select()` and `filter()` which selects 
columns and filters rows, respectively. The function `mutate()` can be used 
to create new columns. We have already seen examples of all of these
in class. 

For example, to select a range of columns by name, use the ":" (colon) operator

```{r}
msleep %>% select(name:order)
```

To select all columns that start with the character string "sl", use the 
function `starts_with()`

```{r}
msleep %>% select(starts_with("sl"))
```

Some additional options to select columns based on a specific criteria include

1. `ends_with()` = Select columns that end with a character string
2. `contains()` = Select columns that contain a character string
3. `matches()` = Select columns that match a regular expression
4. `one_of()` = Select columns names that are from a group of names


#### Assessment

Select all columns except those from `genus` to `conservation` and 
filter the rows for mammals that sleep a total of more than 16 hours
and have a body weight of greater than 1 kilogram

```{r}
## Provide your code here

msleep %>% 
    select(-(genus:conservation)) %>% 
    filter(sleep_total >= 16, bodywt >= 1)
```

#### Assessment (optional)

Select all columns that start with the character string "sl" or ends
with the character string "wt", create a new
column called `rem_proportion` which is the ratio of rem sleep 
to total amount of sleep, create a second column `bodywt_grams` which
is the bodywt column in grams and filter for the rows 20 to 30 in 
the msleep data set by numerical position. 

Hint: Look at the `slice()` help file to filter for rows by numerical 
position. 

```{r}
## Provide your code here

msleep %>% 
    select(starts_with("sl"), ends_with("wt")) %>%
    mutate(rem_proportion = sleep_rem / sleep_total, 
           bodywt_grams = bodywt * 1000) %>%
    slice(20:30)
```


### Arrange or re-order rows using `arrange()`

To arrange (or re-order) rows by a particular column such as the taxonomic
order, list the name of the column you want to arrange the rows by

```{r}
msleep %>% 
    arrange(order)
```


#### Assessment

Select all columns names with the characters "sleep" and arrange the rows 
for the `sleep_rem` in a decreasing order.

Hint: look at the `?arrange` help file for the `desc()` option.

```{r}
## Provide your code here

msleep %>% 
    select(matches("sleep")) %>% 
    arrange(desc(sleep_rem))

```

#### Assessment

Select three columns from `msleep` (`name`, `order`, `sleep_total`), 
arrange the rows in the `sleep_total` column in a descending order, and 
filter the rows for mammals that sleep for a total of 16 or more hours. 

```{r}
msleep %>% 
    select(name, order, sleep_total) %>%
    arrange(order, desc(sleep_total)) %>% 
    filter(sleep_total >= 16)
```



### Create summaries of the data frame using `summarise()`

The `summarise()` function will create summary statistics for a given column 
in the data frame such as finding the mean. For example, to compute the 
average number of hours of sleep, apply the `mean()` function to the 
column `sleep_total` and call the summary value `avg_sleep`. 

```{r}
msleep %>% 
    summarise(avg_sleep = mean(sleep_total))
```

There are many other summary statistics you could consider such `sd()`, 
`min()`, `max()`, `median()`, `sum()`, `n()` (returns the length of vector), 
`first()` (returns first value in vector), `last()` (returns last value in 
vector) and `n_distinct()` (number of distinct values in vector). 


#### Assessment

Summarize `sleep_total` column in the `msleep` data set with the 
average sleep, the minimum and maximum amount of sleep, and the 
total number of mammals. 

```{r}
## Provide your code here

msleep %>% 
    summarise(avg_sleep = mean(sleep_total), 
              min_sleep = min(sleep_total),
              max_sleep = max(sleep_total),
              total = n())
```

    
### Group operations using `group_by()`

The `group_by()` verb is an important function in `dplyr`. As we mentioned 
before it's related to concept of "split-apply-combine". We literally want to 
split the data frame by some variable (e.g. `vore`), apply a 
function to the individual data frames and then combine the output. 

Say we wanted to calculate the standard deviation of the body 
and brain weights for each of factor in the `vore` column.  First, we can 
look at the types of factors in the `vore` column
```{r}
table(msleep$vore)
```

Then, we could use `filter()` to filter for rows that contain "carni" in the 
`vore` column and summarize with the mean of the brain and body
weights. 
```{r}
msleep %>% 
    filter(vore == "carni") %>% 
    summarize("bodywt_sd" = mean(bodywt), 
              "brainwt_sd" = mean(brainwt, na.rm = TRUE))
```

We could repeat this for each factor in `vore`, which is a bit teadious.
Instead, we could use this using the `group_by()` function. 

Let's do that: split the `msleep` data frame by the `vore` column, 
then calculate the mean of body weight and brain weight 
for each invididual data frame. (hint: We expect a set of summary 
statistics for each level in `vore`.)

```{r}
msleep %>% 
    group_by(vore) %>%
    summarize("bodywt_sd" = mean(bodywt), 
              "brainwt_sd" = mean(brainwt, na.rm = TRUE))
```


#### Assessment

Split the `msleep` data frame by the taxonomic order, then for each 
taxonomic order summarize the `sleep_total` with the average sleep, 
the minimum and maximum amount of sleep, and the total number of mammals
in each order. 

```{r}
## Provide your code here

msleep %>% 
    group_by(order) %>%
    summarise(avg_sleep = mean(sleep_total), 
              min_sleep = min(sleep_total), 
              max_sleep = max(sleep_total),
              total = n())
```


#### Assessment (optional)

Create boxplots of the `sleep_total` column split by `vore`. 
```{r}
dat <- msleep %>% 
            filter(!is.na(vore))
ggplot(dat, aes(x=vore, y=sleep_total, fill = vore)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + ylab("Sleep Total (hrs)") + 
    labs(title = "Sleep total (split by vore)")
```

# joining two data frames in `dplyr`

The last part of `dplyr` that we will discuss are a set of `dplyr` 
verbs that allow you to join two data sets.

`dplyr` verbs to join two tables (`x`, `y`) | Description
--- | ---
`inner_join(x, y)` | join data (retain only rows in both sets)
`left_join(x, y)` | join matching rows from `y` to `x`
`right_join(x, y)` | join matching rows from `x` to `y`
`full_join(x, y)` | join data (retain all values, all rows)
`semi_join(x, y)` | all rows in `x` that match in `y`
`anti_join(x, y)` | all rows in `x` that do have a match in `y`


## Data

For this section, we will work with two small data sets related to the 
2016 Oscars Nominations. The two data sets are `oscars` and `movies`.  The 
first data set contains information about the the name of the actor/actress,
the name of the movie and the category for nomination.  The second 
data set contains a list of movies and the length of the movie in minutes. 

We will explore the `dplyr` verbs to join the two tables.  First let's load
the data. 

```{r}
library(readr)

oscars <-"
name,movie,category
Adam McKay,The Big Short,Best Director
Alejandro González Iñárritu,The Revenant,Best Director
Lenny Abrahamson,Room,Best Director
Tom McCarthy,Spotlight,Best Director
George Miller,Mad Max: Fury Road,Best Director
Bryan Cranston,Trumbo,Best Actor
Matt Damon,The Martian,Best Actor
Michael Fassbender,Steve Jobs,Best Actor
Leonardo DiCaprio,The Revenant,Best Actor
Eddie Redmayne,The Danish Girl,Best Actor
Cate Blanchett,Carol,Best Actress
Brie Larson,Room,Best Actress
Jennifer Lawrence,Joy,Best Actress
Charlotte Rampling,45 Years,Best Actress
Saoirse Ronan,Brooklyn,Best Actress
"
oscars <- read_csv(oscars, trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 1)
oscars 

movies <-"
movie,length_mins
The Big Short,130
Star Wars: The Force Awakens,135
Brooklyn,111
Mad Max: Fury Road,120
Room,118
The Martian,144
The Revenant,156
Spotlight,128
"
movies <- read_csv(movies, trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 1)
movies 
```

### inner_join()

> inner_join(x, y): Return all rows from x where there are matching 
values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches
between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.

```{r}
inner_join(oscars, movies, by = "movie")
inner_join(movies, oscars, by = "movie")
```

### semi_join()

> semi_join(x, y): Return all rows from x where there are matching values 
in y, keeping just columns from x. A semi join differs from an 
inner join because an inner join will return one row of x for 
each matching row of y, where a semi join will never duplicate 
rows of x.

```{r}
semi_join(oscars, movies, by = "movie")
semi_join(movies, oscars, by = "movie")
```

### left_join()

> left_join(x, y): Return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. 
If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the 
matches are returned. 

```{r}
left_join(oscars, movies, by = "movie")
left_join(movies, oscars, by = "movie")
```


### right_join()

> right_join(x, y): Return all rows from y, and all columns from x and y. 
If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the 
matches are returned.

```{r}
right_join(oscars, movies, by = "movie")
right_join(movies, oscars, by = "movie")
```


### full_join()

> full_join(x, y): Return all rows and all columns from both x and y. 
Where there are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.

```{r}
full_join(oscars, movies, by = "movie")
full_join(movies, oscars, by = "movie")
```

### anti_join()

> anti_join(x, y): Return all rows from x where there are not matching 
values in y, keeping just columns from x.

```{r}
anti_join(oscars, movies, by = "movie")
anti_join(movies, oscars, by = "movie")
```
